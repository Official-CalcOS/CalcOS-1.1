But its a party for the Functions! (Refer to "commonly used.txt" for context)

Start()
Displays "CalcOS by Jack warren"
This Only appears Once above "opselect" on the startup of the program. After this
you shouldn't see it again.

opselect()
Displays guide text which lets you choose your desired operations.

simpleint()
Starts Simple Interest. Lets you calculate simple interest.

compoundint()
Starts Compound Interest. Lets you calculate compound interest.

genmaths()
Allows the inputs of standard maths (Add, subtract, divide, multiply, power of)
Brackets can be used and nested!

pythag()
Starts Pythagoras. Allows you to complete Pythagoras's theorum including all rearangments of it.
This also has redundancy so theres no way you can divide by 0 or have C shorter than A or B

delPI()
A very tasty Pi! Print Pi as well.

statistics()
Starts Statistics, a new sub menu that allows for a selection of many statistical operations

mean()
Finds Average of a list of numbers that the user inputs

median()
Finds the middle value of a list of numbers that the user inputs

CrashStopperPy() and CrashStopperSimpnum()
Prevents the program from closing on invalid inputs
VERY handy.

CrashHandler()
Usually seen after an "except:" at the end of a mathmatical function,
which is its natural habitat. The "except:" is caught by the "Try:" 
This prevents calcOS Crashing unnexpectedly on any error within the function that hasnt already been handled.

WhyQuit()
Why would you quit the program anyway... (quits the program).

req_update()
Allows you to bring an issue to justice by alerting me of its presence by going 
to the website and messaging me about it or you could alternatively download the latest version.
