Hey there! if you didnt know yet my name is Jack Warren,

I've made this python calculator open scource so feel free to download it, share it to 
anyone you meet, greet or want to defeat in maths! Just try not to edit and redistribute it as your own. 
I plan to have more features coming so stay tuned!

This Patch Brings many new things!
- Complete Overhaul and optimization to the calculator
- Now everything is defined as a function, slower initial load, faster loads after!
- Anti-Crash measures! No more having to reopen the file if you accidentally make it mad!
- Included Statistics! (Mean, Median, mode?, Variance and Standard Deviation)

**Im a beginer still, please leave any sugestions in the GitHub comments or contact me on my website stated below**

- Loading screen is faster (Reduced original code for compound interest by about 500 lines)
- I legally Own It! Yay! No more stealies!
- CalcOS is even Kinder once an operation has been complete
- You can now report bugs!
- Statistics, bug report and compount interest has had major improvements
- Quality of life improvements

This package includes:
-Version 1.2 of the CalcOS (later than the 2.2)
-Documentation for the Functions and commonly used things throughout the project
-A freindly letter from the developer
